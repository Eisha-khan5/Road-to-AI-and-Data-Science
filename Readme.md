# 👋 Welcome to My Data Science & AI Repository

 This repository is a reflection of my **learning journey, practical implementations**, and growing expertise in the field of **Artificial Intelligence**.

Over the past semesters and self-learning efforts, I’ve been continuously building up my skills — starting from core Python programming to advanced machine learning, statistical analysis, and deep learning applications.

This repo is my curated knowledge base, where I’ve documented everything I’ve learned and practiced so far. If you're starting your own journey, this might serve as a valuable resource too.
